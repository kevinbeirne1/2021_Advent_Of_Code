## Problem Overview
- 01a - Given an array of numbers count the number of times that numbers[ i ] > numbers[ i + 1]
- 01b - With the same array of numbers count the number of times that group numbers[ i : i + 3] > numbers[ i + 1 : i + 4]
- 02a - Given an array of `direction number` calculate a final position vector
- 02b - With same array, directions have different affects
- 03a - Array of binary numbers - get the most common bit at each position, and it's bit inverse
- 03b - With same array, at each bit position exclude the numbers that have the most/least common bit at that position.
- 04a - Array of bingo boards and drawn numbers, multiply the last drawn number by the sum of the non called numbers in winning board
- 04b - Same array, get the same product for the last winning board
- 05a - Array of vent vectors, calculate the number of nodes where horizontal/vertical vectors that overlap
- 05b - Same array, now include diagonal vectors
- 06a - Array of times till fish births (with fixed period for birth), calculate the population after 80 days
- 06b - Same array, calculate the population after 256 days
- 07a - Array of nodes. Find the minimum of the distances from each node to a single other node
- 07b - Same array, distance value increases at greater rate when further away. Calculate the new minimum node position
